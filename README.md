# Out-of-proc WinRT Server with C# + CsWinRT

A sample demonstrates out-of-process WinRT server with C# + CsWinRT.

## What is an out-of-proc WinRT Server

The Windows Runtime (WinRT) supports the concept of Out Of Process (OOP) Servers, which allows for using objects that are in a different process (or even a different machine) as though they were in the local process. 

## Why?

### Cross language

It uses WinRT for communication so that any language that can use WinRT is able to be a WinRT server or serve as a client of a WinRT server.

### Easy to use with async support

With built-in support for async primitives such as `IAsyncAction`, `IAsyncOperation<T>` and etc., it is easy to work with async code.

### Complex types

Most RPC/ICP systems are just sending messages between the two processes. At most they can serialize and deserialize an object.

WinRT allows for more complicated objects, where the returned types can have methods, events, and properties. If you could do it with a local object, you can do it with a remote object. 

## Usage

### Server project

The server project need to provide the implementation of types, and it uses CsWinRT to automatically generate interop code and winmd file, where the winmd file is served as a contrast to be used between server and clients.

If you add a class, make sure you also:

1. Register an activation factory for it in the `RoRegisterActivationFactories` call.
2. Add it as an `ActivatableClass` in `Package.appxmanifest`.

### Client project

The client project only needs to consume the winmd file generated by the server project, all the server activation, type instantiation and marshaling things will be automatically done by CsWinRT.

## Notes for workaround

Current the DesktopBridge project system (i.e. wapproj) has two issues need to workaround.

1. The winmd needs to be removed from `_AppxWinmdFilesToHarvest`, see the target `RemoveOutOfProcWinMD` in the wapproj. Otherwise an incorrect `inProcessServer` entry will be added to the manifest despite there's no `inProcessServer` at all, which will make the build fail. This is because the project system assumes all winmd references are meant to be in-process servers, while we are actually using an out-of-process server.
2. The server project also needs to include the winmd file in the `ItemGroup`, otherwise the server implementation (i.e. `WinRTServer.dll` in this demo) will be removed from the package layout if you publish it to appx package, which can lead to failure while starting the server. This is because in the in-process server case, the server implementation should be placed next to the client as it will be loaded into the client process, however, it's not the case for out-of-process. Here the toolchain again assumes we are using an in-process server and does this unnecessary thing for us.
